# Syntax Highlighter

A very newbie approach to make a syntax highlighter only available in JavaScript at the moment. May add new languages in future.

## Installation

You can use this in HTML files by including these two lines in your `<head>` tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://d3fau4t.github.io/Syntax-Highlighter/Themes/peacock.css">
<script src="https://d3fau4t.github.io/Syntax-Highlighter/Languages/javascript.js" defer></script>
```

## Usage

You can use the highlighter by putting your code inside of:

```html
<pre>
    <code class="lang-js">Your code goes here in this block</code>
<pre>
```

**Note:** The class `lang-js` determines which codeblocks to highlight as the desired language. Check supported languages below to use a class tailored to the language

## Supported Languages

These are the languages currently supported and some other languages to support in the future depending upon my availability.
